## 5. The Technology Behind Your Website

Your website is built using modern and reliable web technologies:

*   **Foundation:** HTML5 (for structure), CSS3 (for styling and a beautiful look).
*   **Interactivity & Enhancements:** JavaScript (for features like the mobile menu, contact form operations, map, and animations).
*   **Specialized Tools:**
    *   **LeafletJS:** Powers the interactive map on the Contact page.
    *   **Font Awesome:** Provides a wide range of high-quality icons.
    *   **GSAP (Optional):** If advanced animations are used (e.g., on the Clients page), this powerful animation library is employed.
*   **Static Site - Secure & Fast:** This website is built as a "static site." This means it's inherently very secure and loads quickly for visitors. The contact form relies on a secure method to deliver messages to you (either through a third-party service or a small, dedicated backend script if configured).

## 6. How Your Website is Organized: File Structure

For technical reference, here's a simplified overview of the project's organization:

*   `js/`: Contains JavaScript files (`main.js`, `animations.js`) that power interactive features.
*   `pages/`: This folder contains all the individual HTML files for each page of your website (e.g., `index.html` for the homepage, `about.html`, etc.).
*   `manifest.json` & `sw.js`: Files that enable the "app-like" PWA features.
*   `robots.txt`: A guide for search engine crawlers.

## 9. Being Seen & Easy to Use: SEO and PWA Features

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Making You Easy to Find

Your website has been built with search engines in mind, so potential customers can find you more easily on Google and other search platforms. This includes:

*   **Relevant Page Titles and Descriptions:** Each page clearly tells search engines what it's about.
*   **Structured Content:** Using proper HTML that search engines can understand.
*   **Image Descriptions (`alt` text):** Helps search engines "see" your images.
*   **Mobile-Friendliness:** A key factor for search engine ranking.
*   **Fast Loading Speed:** Optimized for quick loading, which search engines prefer.
*   **Technical Files (`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`):** Guide search engines on how to crawl and index your site effectively.
*   **Structured Data (JSON-LD):** Provides rich information about your business (name, address, services) directly to search engines.

### Progressive Web App (PWA): An Enhanced Browsing Experience

Your website includes PWA features, offering app-like benefits to your users:

*   **Add to Home Screen:** Visitors (especially on mobile) can add your website to their device's home screen for quick access, just like a native app.
*   **Works Better Offline:** Key parts of your website and its core assets are cached. This means if a user revisits your site with a weak or no internet connection, they can still access previously viewed content, and the site will load much faster.
*   **Reliable Performance:** Caching contributes to a consistently faster and more reliable experience.

## 10. Inclusive Design: Accessibility (a11y)

We strive to make your website accessible to as many people as possible, including those with disabilities who may use assistive technologies like screen readers. This involves:

*   **Semantic HTML:** Using HTML tags correctly to define the structure and meaning of content.
*   **Image Alt Text:** Providing descriptions for images.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensuring the site can be navigated using only a keyboard.
*   **Sufficient Color Contrast:** Making text easy to read against its background.
*   **Clear Link Text:** Using descriptive text for links.
*   **Responsive Design:** Ensuring content reflows and is usable on different screen sizes and zoom levels.

*(Note: Full accessibility compliance is an ongoing process and often requires specific audits and testing.)*

## 11. Getting Your Website Live: Setup & Deployment

*   **Hosting:** This website is designed as a static site, meaning it can be hosted on a wide variety of platforms, including traditional cPanel hosting, or modern static site hosts like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS S3, etc.
*   **Domain:** Ensure your domain name (e.g., `micorptrd.com`) is pointed correctly to your hosting server.
*   **HTTPS (SSL Certificate):** Essential for security and PWA functionality. Ensure a valid SSL certificate is installed and active for your domain.
*   **Uploading Files:** Upload all the files and folders from this project (maintaining the directory structure) to your web server's root directory (often `public_html` or `www`).
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test all pages, links, forms, and responsive behavior on different devices and browsers once live.

## 12. Looking Ahead: Future Enhancements

This website provides a strong foundation. Potential future enhancements could include:

*   **Blog/News Section:** To share industry insights, company updates, and improve SEO.

## 13. Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **Animations Not Working:**
    *   Ensure `animations.js` and `animations.css` are correctly linked in your HTML files.
    *   Check the browser console (F12) for any JavaScript errors.
*   **PWA Install Prompt Not Appearing:**
    *   Verify HTTPS is active.
    *   Check the "Application" tab in browser DevTools:
        *   **Manifest:** Errors? Correct `start_url`, `icons` (192px & 512px required), `display` mode?
        *   **Service Workers:** Is `sw.js` registered, activated, and running? Does it have a `fetch` handler?
    *   User engagement heuristics might apply (visit the site a few times).
    *   Run a Lighthouse audit for PWA checks.
*   **Contact Form Not Sending Emails:**
    *   If using a third-party service (e.g., Formspree): Check your account dashboard with the service for configuration issues or submission logs. Ensure the `action` URL in your form is correct.
    *   If using a custom backend: This requires server-side code which is not included here. The backend script would need to be debugged.
*   **Layout Issues on Specific Devices:**
    *   Use browser developer tools to inspect the CSS and identify which rules are causing the problem.
    *   Adjust media queries in `style.css` as needed.
